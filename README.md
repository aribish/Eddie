# Eddie
A Vim-inspired modal text editor

This project is very much a work in progress. Below is a list of major features I intend to add soon:
* File save messages
* Plugin system
* Color printing (for status and title bars)
* Line wrapping

# Build
Run `make` to produce an executable named `eddie`. A file path is required as the only argument
when running this program.

# Commands
### COMMAND MODE
`r` - Enter REPLACE mode

`i` - Enter INSERT mode

`w` - Write buffer

`q` - Quit

Arrow keys to move

### INSERT/REPLACE MODE
`Esc` - Enter COMMAND mode
